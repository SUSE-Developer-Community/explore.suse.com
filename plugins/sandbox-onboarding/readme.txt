with other web based developer tools, such as various sandboxes, playgrounds 
and such.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the plugin needed? =
	
This plugin implements the CAP Sandbox Onboarding API. It provides a place
for Wordpress admin to configure various aspects of the process as well as 
for users a rather easy UI to manage sandbox accounts, which is not possible
in upstream CAP yet.

More on the onboarding API can be found here:
https://github.com/SUSE-Developer-Community/cap-sandbox-onboarding

= Where is the plugin used? =
	
The plugin is installed and used at SUSE Developer Portal, where users can 
request access for sandboxes, such as SUSE's Cloud Application Platform. 

= How can I contribute? =
