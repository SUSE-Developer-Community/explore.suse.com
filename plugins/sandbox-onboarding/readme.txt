Sandbox Onboarding is a tool for Wordpress administrators to connect Wordpress 
with other web based developer tools, such as various sandboxes, playgrounds 
and such.

== Description ==

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the plugin needed? =
	
Integrating web services today would not need yet another plugin. Due to legal 
reasons we need inform users about the service they are about to enroll, and 
more importantly about the use of their personal data, or information that can 
identify them when using the service. For this reason we developed the plugin, 
which let's the Wordpress admins to configure a terms and condition (T&C) page,
and blocks the account creation until the user has given her / his consent to 
using the data as described in the T&C.

= Where is the plugin used? =
	
The plugin is installed and used at SUSE Developer Portal, where users can 
request access for sandboxes, such as SUSE's Cloud Application Platform.
