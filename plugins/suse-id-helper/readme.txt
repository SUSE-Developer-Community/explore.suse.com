SUSE ID Helper is a plugin that helps site admins to configure settings, such as
SSO login redirect link, registration link and account update page. 

== Description ==

The plugin helps site builders to manage settings that can be used across 
Wordpress. 

Some of the settings are pointing to the SUSE identity management system, hence 
those are better handled as saved config settings as opposed to hard coded 
values in the theme. That is the main reason of creating this simple plugin.

The plugin also provides shortcodes for the configured URLs, and in addition to
that it also gives a shortcode for the default Wordpress logout URL just for 
convenience: 

[logout_url label="Logout"]
